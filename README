I wrote this for a server that I wouldn't be managing in person anymore.
It has a UPS for its external HDDs but getting signals from the UPS is a slight pain.
So I wrote a timer based off of the ACPI for the Laptop (the server is a laptop).

I also wrote a daemon script for Arch Linux for easy on/off.
